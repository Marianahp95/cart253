// Griddie
//
// A class defining the behaviour of a single Griddie
// which can move randomly in the window (within the grid),
// loses energy per move, and gains energy from overlapping
// with another Griddie.

class Griddie {
  // Limits for energy level and gains/losses
  int maxEnergy = 255;

    // it checks if the griddie ran out of energy (died) and returns a true or false
    if (energy == 0) {

    // QUESTION: How does the Griddie movement updating work?
    // the griddie can randomly move in -1, 0 or 1 in x and y direction within the spots in the grid (that' why it's multiplied by size)

    // QUESTION: What are these if statements doing?
    // they are checking whether the griddies are trying to escape the grid (position outside the screen) and preventing them from doing so by
    // either adding or substracting from the width and height, keeping the inside the grid.
